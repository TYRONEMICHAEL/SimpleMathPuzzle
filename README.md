This repository serves as the source to the following [blog post](http://tyronemichael.com/tdd-part-1-building-a-game-without-ever-opening-the-browser/).  Just run `npm install` to install the dependancies. Finally run `gulp` to build the application source files. If you open the index.html file, you should be presented with 'Initializing our game...' in the console.

Running `gulp test` or `npm test` will launch you into our testing environment.
